# Bare-Metal LED Blink on STM32F407 Discovery

This demo turns on and blinks the green onboard LED (PD12) using **bare-metal C**, with **no HAL or CubeMX**.

## üîß Key Concepts
- RCC peripheral clock enabled via direct memory access
- GPIO configured using bitmasking on MODER
- Output toggled via direct writes to ODR
- Delay loop implemented using a simple for-loop

## üí° Addresses Used
| Register | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| RCC_AHB1ENR | 0x40023830 | Enables GPIOD clock |
| GPIOD_MODER | 0x40020C00 | Configures pin mode |
| GPIOD_ODR | 0x40020C14 | Output data register |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- This is a low-level test used to understand how embedded systems interact with hardware directly.
- The LED is connected to PD12, which maps to LD4 (green) on the STM32F407 Discovery board.
